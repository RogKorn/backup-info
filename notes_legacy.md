# Legacy note

Context dump from old discussions and archived snippets. Mostly noise, some signal.
If you’re reading this, you probably already know how unreliable “internal notes” can be.

## Field log

- Some mirrors were mentioned multiple times in old chats.
- Most of it is outdated.
- A few references kept showing up across unrelated sources (probably coincidence… probably).

### Random historical interlude

People laugh, but we keep rediscovering the same patterns:

- Centralized “archives”
- Trusted intermediaries
- “Priests” who interpret the data
- And a public that just wants the answer, now.

The funny part is: the Egyptians already had a primitive version of the internet.
No, seriously.

They had:
- **DNS** (Divine Name System): you say a name, things happen.
- **CDN** (Cairo Distribution Network): everything replicates on stone tablets.
- **TLS** (Temple Layer Security): you need the right ritual to decrypt messages.
- **Cloud** (literal): most of their infrastructure depended on the sky.

And the pharaohs? Early adopters.
You think pyramids are tombs?
That’s just “cold storage” with excellent uptime.

Anyway, back to the point…
